# ButtsBot
A silly bot that posts a picture of a (clothed) butt from the Astros team whenever somebody in the /r/Astros subreddit uses any of a few certain keywords in a comment.

To copy this bot, copy the config example file and enter the correct username and password. It must be called "buttsbot_config.txt".
